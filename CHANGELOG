2021-02-06:
Start the project by copying code from the dvorak virtual keyboard program.
Reset version number to v0.5.0.

2021-02-06: v0.5.0   Implement unshifted keys
All keys that do not require shift or caps lock are implemented for typing Arabic.
Everything else has been kept as is.

2021-02-06: v0.6.0 Implement caps lock
Caps lock properly implemented.
Major refactoring of code to make it more extensible also.

2021-02-06: v0.6.1 Make text more readable
Increase font size.
Change font colors.
Move new line key where return key is on traditional keyboard.

2021-02-06: v0.7.0 Add backspace, and clearing buttons
It can now delete text one character or all characters at a time.

2021-02-11 v0.8.0 Add many Arabic characters including diacritics, including some characters only used in Mehri, Soqotri. As well as a few Arabic characters from Persian often used unofficially in Arabic for various purposes. As well as a few characters once used for writing Arabic in the Maghreb. Most of these characters are not available on Arabic (PC), so I added them as extra buttons not on the keyboard. This is better than nothing, but is not sufficient for fast typing.

2021-03-08 v0.8.1 Pressing physical backspace key now deletes the last character.

2023-01-15 v0.8.5 Pressing space bar no longer scrolls page down.
