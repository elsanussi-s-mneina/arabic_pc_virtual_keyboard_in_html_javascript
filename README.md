# Arabic (PC) Virtual Keyboard Layout

So far only the normal keys are implemented. Shift, and caps lock do not work as expected yet. [Use now](https://elsanussi-s-mneina.github.io/u/ar_pc_virt.html).

## History:
This project started on February 6, 2021.
It starts as a modification of the DVORAK virtual keyboard layout made by the same software developer and available at the following web address: https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/dvorak_virtual_keyboard_in_html_javascript

## Introduction
This is an application that runs in the web browser, and allows the user to type using the Arabic (PC) keyboard layout without having to install it anywhere.

## Use Case
You need to type Arabic, and are used to typing Arabic before but often have to type on computers without the Arabic (PC) keyboard layout installed. Installing the Arabic (PC) layout on the other computers would be too inconvenient.

## User Requirements
  - Web browser with Javascript enabled


## Developer Requirements
 - Web browser (with Javascript enabled)
 - Source code or plain text editor
